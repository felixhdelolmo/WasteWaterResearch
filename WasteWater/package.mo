  Documentation(info="This package can be used to model and simulate biological municipal
wastewater treatment plants.

The package WasteWater provides a collection of 3 different
international accepted (a)ctivated (s)ludge (m)odels (ASM) of different complexity,
including models for preclarifiers and 5 different models for
the secondary settling process.

PS: SimulationTimeUnit for all models built with the WasteWater library is days [d].
