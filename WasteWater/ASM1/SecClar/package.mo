  Documentation(info="This library provides a collection of ASM1 secondary clarifier models based on
several theories.

The library currently is structured in following sub-libraries.

 - Takacs: secondary clarifier model by Takacs et al [1]
 - Haertel: secondary clarifier model by Haertel [2]
 - Otterpohl: secondary clarifier model by Otterpohl [3]
 - Krebs: secondary clarifier model by Krebs [4]
 - Simple: very basic secondary clarifier model
